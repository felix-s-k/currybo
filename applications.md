# Generality-Oriented Optimization in the Natural Sciences

Generally: any scenario where we want to use the same procedure across a set of related tasks, but don't have the resources to optimize each task individually

## Synthetic Chemistry

- General reaction conditions for different substrates

## Analytical Chemistry

- General instrument / measurement parameters for different types of samples (e.g. NMR pulses, HPLC gradients, ...)

## Computational Chemistry

- Identification (or maybe optimization) of density functionals for different types of chemical systems
- Tuning of force field parameters

## Mechanical Engineering

- Optimization of control parameters for Segways over different types of human drivers
